# Zomato Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering (FE)

## üìã Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering (FE)** for the Zomato dataset, which provides insights into restaurant data, including customer reviews, ratings, and various attributes of restaurants. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for uncovering trends in customer preferences and enhancing analytical capabilities for decision-making in the food and beverage industry.

- **Objective**: Analyze restaurant data to understand customer behavior and engineer relevant features to extract actionable insights or prepare for predictive modeling.
- **Dataset**: The Zomato dataset, available on Kaggle, contains information such as restaurant names, locations, cuisines, ratings, and reviews.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This section involves analyzing the dataset to reveal patterns, relationships, and potential areas for feature engineering. Typical steps include:

- **Data Overview**: Overview of the dataset, including restaurant attributes, customer ratings, and review counts. The dataset contains thousands of records, offering diverse insights.
- **Missing Values & Data Cleaning**: Identification and handling of any missing or inconsistent data entries.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Exploring the distribution of key variables such as ratings, cuisine types, and location demographics to identify trends.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between restaurant ratings, price ranges, and other relevant features. Visualizations such as heatmaps and box plots help identify significant trends.

### Key Visualizations
- **Ratings Distribution**: Charts illustrating the distribution of restaurant ratings across different cities or cuisines.
- **Cuisine Popularity**: Analysis of popular cuisines based on average ratings or review counts.
- **Geographic Insights**: Visualizations showing restaurant density and customer preferences by location.

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering (FE)
New features were engineered to enhance future analyses and predictive modeling capabilities. Common approaches include:

- **Customer Preferences**: Features that capture the most preferred cuisines or restaurant types based on customer ratings.
- **Rating Scales**: Encoding the rating system to categorize restaurants into tiers (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **Review Analysis**: Creating features from textual reviews, such as sentiment scores or keyword counts, to capture customer sentiments.
- **Price Encoding**: Encoding price range features into numerical values for improved model input.

## üìä Results & Insights
The EDA and Feature Engineering phases provided valuable insights, such as:

- **High-Rated Cuisines**: Identified which cuisines generally receive higher ratings, suggesting customer preferences.
- **Location Trends**: Noted spending patterns and ratings based on geographic segments, useful for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Impact of Reviews on Ratings**: Analyzed how the volume and sentiment of reviews correlate with restaurant ratings.

These findings offer a strong foundation for targeted marketing, restaurant recommendations, and predictive modeling.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To explore this project on your machine:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies (if available) via `requirements.txt`.
3. Open and execute the Jupyter notebooks to replicate the EDA and feature engineering steps.

## üí° Future Work
Potential next steps to expand this project include:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Train models to predict restaurant ratings or customer preferences.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Experiment with natural language processing techniques on reviews for deeper insights.
- **Trend Analysis**: Investigate trends over time to forecast future restaurant performance or customer preferences.
